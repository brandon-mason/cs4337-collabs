The primary tool, `ImageAdjuster`, is designed to allow real-time image adjustments for **Light**, **Color**, and **Effects**. While most of the code is already implemented, the **Color** and **Effects** functions are incomplete.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Initial Setup:**\n",
        "   - You will be provided with a partially completed code for an `ImageAdjuster` class, which uses sliders to adjust properties of an image.\n",
        "   - The code handles **Light** controls (exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, blacks), but the **Color** and **Effects** functions are incomplete.\n",
        "   - Your duty is to fill in the `adjust_temperature()`, `adjust_tint()`, `adjust_vibrance()`, `adjust_saturation()`, `adjust_texture()`, `adjust_clarity()`, `adjust_dehaze()`, `apply_vignette()`, and `add_grain()` functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Docstrings and Type Hinting:**\n",
        "   - You must provide **clear and concise docstrings** for all functions.\n",
        "   - Add **type hints** to function signatures to specify input and output types.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Function Descriptions and Tasks:**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Color Adjustments** (Fill in these functions using OpenCV):\n",
        "   - **`adjust_temperature()`**: Adjust the color temperature by manipulating the blue channel of the image.\n",
        "   - **`adjust_tint()`**: Adjust the tint by altering the green channel.\n",
        "   - **`adjust_vibrance()`**: Enhance the vibrance of the image by selectively increasing the intensity of less saturated areas.\n",
        "   - **`adjust_saturation()`**: Modify the overall saturation by working in the HSV color space to change the saturation channel.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Effects Adjustments** (Fill in these functions using OpenCV):\n",
        "   - **`adjust_texture()`**: Implement a method to enhance textures using unsharp masking. Research how blurring and subtracting the blurred image from the original enhances texture.\n",
        "   - **`adjust_clarity()`**: Boost midtone contrast to enhance local details using local contrast enhancement.\n",
        "   - **`adjust_dehaze()`**: Reduce haze by manipulating the brightness of darker areas.\n",
        "   - **`apply_vignette()`**: Apply a vignette effect by creating a radial mask that darkens the edges more than the center.\n",
        "   - **`add_grain()`**: Add noise to the image to simulate film grain. Use random Gaussian noise and add it to the image to create this effect.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Docstrings and Type Hints (25% of the grade)**:\n",
        "   - Every function in the `ImageAdjuster` class should include a docstring explaining what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns.\n",
        "   - Add **type hints** wherever needed. This includes specifying the input types (e.g., `image: np.ndarray`) and the return types (e.g., `-> None`).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Task Completion (65% of the grade)**:\n",
        "   - **Implement the Color and Effects functions** using OpenCV.\n",
        "   - Ensure the sliders in the Panel UI correctly adjust the image properties.\n",
        "   - Each function should work independently and integrate with the overall image adjustment pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Open-Ended Reflection (10% of the grade)**:\n",
        "   - Answer the following questions in a separate markdown cell:\n",
        "     1. **Engagement**: Did this problem engage you, and did it increase your desire to learn more about image processing?\n",
        "     2. **Limitations**: What are the limitations of the current approach in terms of performance, usability, or accuracy?\n",
        "     3. **Improvements**: How would you improve the current tool to make it more efficient, user-friendly, or capable?\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **General Tips**:\n",
        "   - **Restart Session**: This code might be a bit finicky, meaning that when you make changes, you may need to restart your runtime/session to see the effects. If the tool doesn't behave as expected, first ensure that all the requirements are met, and then restart the session.\n",
        "   - **Use OpenCV Documentation**: Research OpenCV functions, such as `cv2.GaussianBlur`, `cv2.cvtColor`, and other tools that can help you implement the required image effects.\n",

        "Sure! Let's dive deeper into the **explanation of each effect** in a more intuitive and detailed way. I'll explain how each effect works, what OpenCV functions can be used, how those functions operate, and how you might apply them to a small example like an 8x8 image with 3 color channels (RGB). We'll also cover the meaning of key parameters and how they affect the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Texture Enhancement** (Unsharp Masking)\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: This effect is used to enhance fine details in the image. It sharpens the image by emphasizing the differences between the original image and a blurred version of itself.\n",
        "   - **How It Works**: We blur the image, subtract the blurred version from the original image, and then add the result back to the original. This highlights the details in the image.\n",
        "   - **OpenCV Function**: `cv2.GaussianBlur()` and simple arithmetic.\n",
        "     - **Function**: `cv2.GaussianBlur(src, ksize, sigmaX)`\n",
        "       - `src`: The input image (e.g., our 8x8 image).\n",
        "       - `ksize`: Size of the Gaussian kernel (e.g., `(9,9)`).\n",
        "       - `sigmaX`: Standard deviation in the X direction (e.g., `2`).\n",
        "     - **Effect**: A larger `ksize` or `sigmaX` means more blurring, which reduces details. Smaller values retain more texture.\n",
        "   - **Toy Example**: Let's assume you have an 8x8 image with RGB channels. Blurring the image with `cv2.GaussianBlur` smooths the image, so when we subtract this blurred image from the original, it emphasizes edges and textures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Clarity Enhancement** (Local Contrast)\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Enhances local contrast by boosting midtone contrasts without significantly altering highlights or shadows.\n",
        "   - **How It Works**: A small Gaussian blur is applied to the image to soften local contrast, then the blurred image is subtracted from the original and the result is added back to enhance clarity.\n",
        "   - **OpenCV Function**: `cv2.GaussianBlur()` (for the blur) and simple arithmetic.\n",
        "     - **Function**: `cv2.GaussianBlur(src, ksize, sigmaX)`\n",
        "       - `ksize`: A small kernel size, e.g., `(3,3)`, is often used for clarity.\n",
        "       - `sigmaX`: Small value (e.g., `2.0`).\n",
        "     - **Effect**: Smaller `ksize` and `sigmaX` enhance clarity by keeping local details sharp. Larger values reduce clarity and increase smoothness.\n",
        "   - **Toy Example**: On an 8x8 image, you can apply a `(3,3)` blur to reduce clarity, then subtract it from the original image. This subtraction emphasizes the fine local details, making the image look sharper.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Dehaze** (Haze Reduction)\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Reduces haze or fog in an image, especially in outdoor scenes where atmospheric conditions can dull the image.\n",
        "   - **How It Works**: Dehazing focuses on increasing contrast and brightness in areas of low intensity (i.e., shadows or darker parts of the image). The haze often reduces contrast, so dehazing boosts these areas.\n",
        "   - **OpenCV Function**: `cv2.cvtColor()` to convert to HSV color space and adjust the value (brightness) channel.\n",
        "     - **Function**: `cv2.cvtColor(src, code)`\n",
        "       - `src`: The input image.\n",
        "       - `code`: Color conversion code, `cv2.COLOR_RGB2HSV` to convert RGB to HSV.\n",
        "     - **Effect**: By modifying the `V` (value) channel of the HSV image, dehaze increases brightness in darker parts of the image.\n",
        "   - **Toy Example**: On an 8x8 image, convert it to HSV using `cv2.cvtColor`. Increase the values in the `V` (brightness) channel to simulate dehazing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Vignette Effect** (Radial Shading)\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Darkens the corners of an image, creating a more focused and artistic look. Often used in photography to draw attention to the center of the image.\n",
        "   - **How It Works**: We create a radial gradient that darkens the corners more than the center, applying this mask over the original image.\n",
        "   - **OpenCV Function**: Use NumPy to create a vignette mask manually.\n",
        "     - **Creating the Mask**: Use meshgrid to calculate the distance from the center for each pixel and then create a darkening mask based on that distance.\n",
        "     - **Effect**: Pixels farther from the center are darkened more, creating a vignette effect.\n",
        "   - **Toy Example**: In an 8x8 image, you can calculate the distance of each pixel from the center of the image. Pixels farther from the center (corners) will be darker.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Grain (Noise Addition)**\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Adds film-like grain or noise to the image. It can create a retro or gritty effect, giving the image texture and a nostalgic look.\n",
        "   - **How It Works**: Add random Gaussian noise to the image to simulate graininess.\n",
        "   - **OpenCV Function**: NumPy is used to generate noise.\n",
        "     - **Generating Noise**: `np.random.normal(mean, std_dev, size)` generates random values from a normal distribution.\n",
        "       - `mean`: The average intensity of the noise (usually 0 for grain).\n",
        "       - `std_dev`: Standard deviation controls the spread of noise (e.g., `0.1`).\n",
        "       - `size`: The size of the image (e.g., 8x8x3 for a small image with 3 channels).\n",
        "     - **Effect**: Higher `std_dev` increases graininess, while lower values make the noise more subtle.\n",
        "   - **Toy Example**: On an 8x8 image, generate random noise using `np.random.normal(0, 0.1, (8,8,3))` and add it to the image to create a grainy effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Putting It Together**:\n",
        "Imagine you have an 8x8 image with 3 color channels (RGB), represented as a NumPy array. Each pixel value in this array ranges from 0 to 1 (if normalized). Here’s how the effects would modify this small image:\n",
        "- **Texture** would emphasize fine details by sharpening differences between neighboring pixels.\n",
        "- **Clarity** would boost the contrast of local midtones, making the image appear clearer.\n",
        "- **Dehaze** would brighten and increase the contrast of darker parts of the image.\n",
        "- **Vignette** would darken the corners relative to the center.\n",
        "- **Grain** would introduce random noise, simulating a film-like texture."

        "### 1. **Temperature**:\n",
        "   - **Intuitive Explanation**: Think of temperature as the \"warmth\" or \"coolness\" of the image. A **higher temperature** makes the image feel \"warmer\" (more yellow/orange), while a **lower temperature** makes the image feel \"cooler\" (more blue).\n",
        "   - **What Happens**: This adjustment increases or decreases the **blue** component of the image.\n",
        "     - **Warm Colors (High Temperature)**: We reduce the blue channel to bring out warmer tones (reds/yellows).\n",
        "     - **Cool Colors (Low Temperature)**: We increase the blue channel to emphasize cooler tones (blues).\n",
        "  \n",
        "### 2. **Tint**:\n",
        "   - **Intuitive Explanation**: Tint adjusts the balance between **green** and **magenta**.\n",
        "     - Increasing tint (positive values) adds a **greenish** cast to the image.\n",
        "     - Decreasing tint (negative values) adds a **magenta** (purple-pink) tone.\n",
        "   - **What Happens**: Tint works by adjusting the **green** channel.\n",
        "     - **More Green**: Green tones are increased, making the image appear more natural or vibrant, especially in landscapes.\n",
        "     - **Less Green (More Magenta)**: The opposite of green is magenta, so lowering the green channel brings out reddish-purple tones.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Vibrance**:\n",
        "   - **Intuitive Explanation**: Vibrance adjusts the **intensity of colors** in a selective manner, mostly affecting the less saturated colors in the image. It enhances color richness without making the already saturated areas look unnatural.\n",
        "   - **What Happens**: Vibrance adjusts the intensity of the colors based on how \"strong\" the colors already are.\n",
        "     - **Higher Vibrance**: Increases the intensity of muted colors while trying to preserve skin tones and areas that are already highly saturated.\n",
        "     - **Lower Vibrance**: Muted colors get even softer, reducing their impact.\n",
        "   - **Difference from Saturation**: Unlike saturation, vibrance is **selective** and affects weaker colors more than stronger ones, leading to a more subtle adjustment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Saturation**:\n",
        "   - **Intuitive Explanation**: Saturation controls the **strength of all colors** in the image, making them more vivid or more muted.\n",
        "     - Higher saturation makes colors more intense and vivid.\n",
        "     - Lower saturation brings colors closer to grayscale (black-and-white).\n",
        "   - **What Happens**: The image is converted to the **HSV color space** (Hue, Saturation, Value), and the saturation channel is adjusted:\n",
        "     - **Higher Saturation**: Colors become more vivid and intense, pushing them toward their pure form.\n",
        "     - **Lower Saturation**: Colors become more muted, fading toward grayscale."
